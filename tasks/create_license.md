# Task: Add LICENSE File

## Issue
There's no `LICENSE` file. Developers won't know the project's license and legal permissions for use and contribution.

## Action
- Add an `LICENSE` file at the project root.
- Use the MIT License (or another chosen open-source license).
- Update `README.md` to reference the license section if needed.
