# 📘 Module 1: AI‑First Principles & Developer Mindset

This module introduces the **AI‑First Software Development (AIFSD)** mindset — a fundamental shift in how we build software in the age of LLMs.

---

## 🧠 What Is AI‑First Software Development?

An AI‑first developer doesn’t just use AI to automate small tasks — they **co-create** software with AI as a thinking partner.

> “Use AI to accelerate the *first draft* of software. Humans own the final merge.” — [AIFSD Manifesto](https://www.tembo.io/blog/ai-first-software-development-manifesto)

## 🧭 Core Principles (Adapted from AIFSD)

| Principle              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Think AI‑First**     | When starting any task, ask: “How would I solve this *with* AI?” |
| **Own the Merge**      | You’re always responsible for quality, even if AI wrote the code |
| **Prompt like a Pro**  | Clear, contextual instructions lead to better outcomes |
| **Refactor Prompt > Code** | Iterate on your prompt instead of manually editing code |
| **Ship Faster**        | Use AI to deliver value quickly and safely |

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflows

- GitHub Copilot & Copilot Chat
- `.copilot-instructions.md` — like a `README` for your AI teammate
- `.prompt.md` — persistent goals and tool config (Beast Mode)
- Prompt tuning strategies (shown live)

## 🧪 Activity: Your First AI Co‑Pilot Prompt

Open any Python/JS file in VS Code, then try one of these prompts:

```
# What does this function do?
# Refactor this to use a list comprehension
# Add type hints and docstrings to this module
```

Or try in Copilot Chat:

```
"Summarize what this Flask app does."
```

## 🧵 Reflection Questions

- What makes a *good* AI prompt? What makes a bad one?
- How would you onboard an AI co-pilot into your team/project?
- Would you feel comfortable reviewing and merging AI-generated code?
