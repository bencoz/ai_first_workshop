# Task: Create `.github/prompts/` Directory

## Issue
Workshop Module 2 and others reference a `.github/prompts/` folder for prompt files, but this folder does not exist.

## Action
- Create a `.github/prompts/` directory at the project root.
- Ensure it is included in version control (update `.gitignore` if necessary).
