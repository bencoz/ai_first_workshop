# Task: Populate `copilot-examples/.copilot-instructions.md`

## Issue
The `copilot-examples/.copilot-instructions.md` file is empty and missing guidance/examples for users to learn how to write Copilot instructions.

## Action
- Add example instructions similar to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Provide context-specific rules for the Flask app (e.g., use snake_case, include type hints).
